#### DeleteOrder Extension

The magento 2 default functionalities does not allow admins or site owners to delete test orders or any other types of orders that has been canceled, closed or shouldn't exist anymore.
So in order to provide such functionality, i developed this module. 
It's easy to use and works like default magento 2 way.
