#### DeleteOrder Extension

The magento 2 default functionalities does not allow admin or site owner to delete test order(s) or any other type of order(s) that has been canceled, closed or shouldn't exist anymore.
So in order to provide such functionality, i developed this module. 
It's easy to use and works like default magento 2 way.
